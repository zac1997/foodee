						<h2>Papdi Chaat</h2>
						<span class="pricing">Rs.250</span>
						<p>Chaat has to be the most popular North-Indian snack. Vendors literally crowd the streets selling all kinds of delicious variations of chaat in this part of the country. Chaat parties are also popular and a great alternative to a sit-down dinner.
						Papdi chaat is a great introduction and a lot of fun to make. The papdi (or papri) are deep-fried dough wafers that can be stored for weeks at a time. With those made, it's just a matter of mixing up the tangy, spicy, and sweet sauce. </p>
